# Stories and Story points

Stories was taken from _extreme programming_ as a tool to know better before hand thw work to do

On Scrum Stories are one type of product backlog, other types can be:

- Features
- Functions
- Requirements
- Enhancements
- Fixes

Stories have three C parts:

- Card: Definition of the story
- Conversation: This conversation happens on backlog refinement
- Confirmation: This includes and Acceptance criteria.

The Scrum team should have the acceptance critirea provider by the user and it helps the build the thing

The definition of done helps the team to build the thing right, with some standars

The story should have following parts:

As <who> 
I want <what> 
So that <why>

The story is intentionally vague to allow the conversation of the team

A way to provide estimations on a team, is to measure with story points,

Story points represents the effort to do a work and it should include the following criterias:

- Volume
- Complexity
- Risk
- Uncertanty

If a story goes beyond a sprint it should be splitted.

Normally a fibonacci series is used for the estimates, so 1 is the smalles work the team can think of

Each team will have its own estimates
