## Introduction

The most successful kinds of machine learning algorithms are those that automate decision-making processes by generalizing from known examples. In this setting, which is known as supervised learning, the user provides the algorithm with pairs of inputs and desired outputs, and the algorithm finds a way to produce the desired output given an input.
Machine learning algorithms that learn from input/output pairs are called supervised learning algorithms

Often it is helpful to think of your data as a table. 
Each data point that you want to reason about (each email, each customer, each transaction) is a row, and each property that describes that data point (say, the age of a customer or the amount or location of a transaction) is a column.
Each entity or row here is known as a sample (or data point) in machine learning, while the columns—the properties that describe these entities—are called features.


While you are building a machine learning solution, you should answer, or at least keep in mind, the following questions:
	• What question(s) am I trying to answer? Do I think the data collected can answer that question?
	• What is the best way to phrase my question(s) as a machine learning problem?
	• Have I collected enough data to represent the problem I want to solve?
	• What features of the data did I extract, and will these enable the right predictions?
	• How will I measure success in my application?
	• How will the machine learning solution interact with other parts of my research or business product?
